        <h1>Object Detector Demo</h1>
        <p>Hello! This website has a powerful object detector, powered by AI and is able to extract and detect location
            of objects in the image.</p>
        <p>Don't believe it? Try it out! You would just need to upload an image using the button below.</p>
        <p>PS: The <em>"threshold"</em> field is the metric of how strict we want the object detector be. For example,
            if we
            set it too low (eg. 0.1), it tends to detect alot of objects and if we set it too high
            (eg. 0.9), it tends to not detect any objects. You can just leave it as
            the default value, which is 0.5, unless you want to experiment with the powerful machine!
