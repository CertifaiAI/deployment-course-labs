# Model Server

For this model server REST API, you can make use of the one you used back in Day 2. However, do take note of the extra step of logging the input data into your log database.

## Hint: 
The input data that will be logged are expected to be extracted image features, hence on top of the image classifier, you have to have another feature extractor model to output the extracted image features.
