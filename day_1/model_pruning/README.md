# Model Pruning 

Since the effect of pruning is not really significant here due to Pytorch's limitation of representing the pruned model (Sparse model) in the same architecture as the unpruned model (dense model), we do not recommend performing pruning at this point. 

However, if you are keen to know more about how to perform model pruning in Pytorch, you can go ahead and check out the demos we've prepared.
