# Model Quantization

There are 2 demos on eager mode quantization, which cover [dynamic quantization](./Demo%20-%20Eager%20Mode%20Dynamic%20Quantization.ipynb) & [static quantization](./Demo%20-%20Eager%20Mode%20Static%20Quantization.ipynb).

Taking reference from the eager mode quantization demos, you are expected to complete an exercise on eager mode quantization, on both dynamic & static quantization.

There is also an exercise on graph mode quantization which is very similar to eager mode quantization. Please try that out on your own too.

Finally, you are expected to make use of the quantized model to perform inference on a single image.

You are expected to complete the exercises in the following order:
1. [1.0 Exercise - Eager Mode Quantization.ipynb](./1.0%20Exercise%20-%20Eager%20Mode%20Quantization.ipynb)
2. [2.0 Exercise - Graph Mode Quantization.ipynb](./2.0%20Exercise%20-%20Graph%20Mode%20Quantization.ipynb)
3. [3.0 Exercise - Quantized Model Inference.ipynb](3.0%20Exercise%20-%20Quantized%20Model%20Inference.ipynb)
